## User Personas

**User A** loves quirky products and would genuinely be interested in buying some of these to give as gifts to friends. They’d love to share their top picks to social media to encourage others to help get the products made. At work they always have the most interesting and well decorated desk with lots of fun toys and knick knacks. 

**User B** is incentive driven and is only completing this survey because they were offered a free bus ride for taking it. They only have a few minutes to complete the survey during their lunch break and want to know how long it’s going to take. He doesn’t want to get bogged down with too many things to click or too much to think about. It should be a fast-paced, impulse-driven game in order to get him to finish it. 

**The Marketing Team** wants to know which products would be most popular in the context of other random products. Since the products don’t have much practical use, it’s most important to see which ones users consider most novel rather than trying to sort by category or anything else. They want to make sure every product is seen at least once and ideally as close to equal as possible so that it has a fair chance of being considered. In terms of results, it’s most interesting which products have the highest clicked:viewed ratio.
